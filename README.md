# Rental-Bike-Rides-Predictor

## `Introduction`
In this project, we'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, we'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. we'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

## `Dataset`
The data comes from the <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset'>UCI Machine Learning Database</a>

## `Instructions`

Create a new conda environment:
```bash
conda create --name deep-learning python=3
```
Enter your new environment:

Mac/Linux: 
```bash
>> source activate deep-learning
```
OR

Windows: 
```bash
>> activate deep-learning
```
Ensure you have `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `jupyter notebook` installed by doing the following:
```bash
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
```
Run the following to open up the notebook server:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
In your browser, open `Predicting Rental-Bike Rides.ipynb`. Note that in the previous workspace this was called Your_first_neural_network.ipynb but the contents are the same, this is just a descriptive difference.

Follow the instructions in the notebook; they will lead you through the project. You'll ultimately be editing the `my_answers.py` python file, whose components are imported into the notebook at various places.

Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook!
